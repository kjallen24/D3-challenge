          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Access to Healthcare and Poverty</h2>
          <p>Although the results differ per state, there is a postive correlation between those citizens who lack healthcare and those living in poverty.
            Two states that are outliers within this data: Massachusetts and Texas. Massachusetts shows as less than 12% of its citizens living in poverty while that same populationis close to zero healthcare.
            It is also worth noting, that the overall income in Massachusetts is above average compared to other less fortunate states in America. Texas, with a extremely high percentage lacking in healthcare, has
            between 15-18% percent of its population living in poverty. Although that is a high percentage, this can be explained by the Texas' low cost of living compared to most of the United States.
            Conclusively, it is reasonable to assume that when there is a lack of healthcare, the population is more at risk to fall below the poverty line.
